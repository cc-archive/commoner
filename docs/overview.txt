OpenID
------

CC Network implements Open ID 2.0.  OpenID support is based on the
`Python OpenID <http://openidenabled.com/python-openid/>`_ library.

Work Registration
-----------------

One of CC Network's goals is to act as a test bed for exploring digital
copyright registry technology.  Part of that includes allowing users
to register works they've created with the CC Network.  The ``works``
application is responsible for this functionality.

Accounts
========

CC Network supports free, premium (paid), and organization accounts.
In many places an account is represented by a :term:`user profile`.

.. NOTE::

   Free accounts are currently disabled on the production site.

Premium accounts are good for one year by default; an
:term:`authorization code` is required to renew the account and
continue using the entire suite of premium features.

Features
--------

Premium and organization accounts have the following features
associated with them:

* OpenID
* Work Registration

.. _account-expiration:

Expiration
----------

Premium accounts have an expiration date associated with them.  When
Premium accounts expire, the following features are disabled:

* Registering new works

Note that a user's OpenID will continue to work and any existing work
registrations will remain intact.

An account which has expired is labeled *inactive*.
