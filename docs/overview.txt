OpenID
------

Commoner implements Open ID 2.0.  OpenID support is based on the
`Python OpenID <http://openidenabled.com/python-openid/>`_ library.

Work Registration
-----------------

One of Commoner's goals is to act as a test bed for exploring digital
copyright registry technology.  Part of that includes allowing users
to register works they've created with Commoner.  The ``works``
application is responsible for this functionality.
