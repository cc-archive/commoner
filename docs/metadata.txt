Work Registration
-----------------

Work registration relies reciprocal metadata published on the work page
and on the registry.  

Asserting Ownership
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The work page publishes ``sioc:has_owner``
information pointing at the registry page.  Commoner implements this
in the network "badge" using RDFa.  The triples published on the work
page are::

  <WORK_PAGE> <http://rdfs.org/sioc/ns#has_owner> <OWNER_PAGE> .
  <WORK_PAGE> <http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml/vocab#license> <LICENSE_URL> .

The registry must publish triples describing a reciprocal
relationship.  Commoner publishes these triples on the profile page,
the full work list and the individual work pages.  Clients should
traverse ``rdf:seeAlso`` and ``sioc:has_owner`` to ensure full
discovery.  The reciprocal relationship is described by
``sioc:owner_of``.  For example::

  <OWNER_PAGE> <http://rdfs.org/sioc/ns#owner_of> <WORK_PAGE> .

In addition to the reciprocal ownership information, the registry may
publish metadata connecting the work page to the individual
registation page.  This is done using ``sioc:parent_of`` and
``sioc:has_parent``.  The registration page is declared as the
``sioc:parent_of``  the work page.  The work page is declared to
``sioc:has_parent`` the registration page.

Wildcards
:::::::::

Registries may also indicate that a registration is applicable to a
group of works, indicated by one or more ``powder:iriset``. The
``iriset`` is a property of the registration page.  Each
``powder:iriset`` includes zero or more ``powder:includeregex`` and
zero or more ``powder:excluderegex`` statements.  If a work page
publishes ownership information which leads to the discovery of a work
parent, the work page must pass **all** statements (inclusion and
exclusion) in a ``powder:iriset`` of the parent to verify the claim.

See the `POWDER Grouping of Resources
<http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/WD-powder-grouping-20080815/#reMatch>`_
documentation for more details on the regular expression usage.

For example::

  <http://example.org/work> <http://rdfs.org/sioc/ns#has_parent> 
     <http://registry.example.org/registration/page/> .

  <http://registry.example.org/registration/page/>  
    <http://rdfs.org/sioc/ns#parent_of> <http://example.org/work> .
  <http://registry.example.org/registration/page/> 
     <http://www.w3.org/2007/05/powder#iriset> _:n1 .

  _:n1 <http://www.w3.org/2007/05/powder#includeregex> 
     "\\:\\/\\/(([^\\/\\?\\#]*)\\@)?([^\\:\\/\\?\\#\\@]*)(\\:([0-9]+))?(\\/work)"@en .
  _:n1 <http://www.w3.org/2007/05/powder#includeregex> "\\:\\/\\/(([^\\/\\?\\#]*)\\@)?([^\\:\\/\\?\\#\\@]+\\.)?(example\\.org)(\\:([0-9]+))?\\/"@en .
  _:n1 <http://www.w3.org/2007/05/powder#includeregex> "^(http)\\:\\/\\/"@en .

Describes a relationship which would verify a claim that
``http://example.org/work/sub-page`` is registered in a group
registration.

.. admonition:: POWDER Compliance

  Commoner and the specification in this document **DOES NOT** comply
  with POWDER or the POWDER RDF schema.  We have attempted to reuse
  vocabulary where appropriate without introducing complexity for 
  consumers.  This feature may change dramatically in the future to 
  become compliant.


Registration Details
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Details regarding the registration may be published on the
registration page.  This includes -- but is not limited to -- the
registration date (``dct:created``) and any ``powder:iriset``.


Owner Information
-----------------

Registries should publish ``sioc:name`` information for work owners.
``sioc:name`` should be the most accurate name available.  For
example, the owner's legal name as opposed to their screen name.

Registry Information
--------------------

Registries should publish information regarding the site.  The minimum
information is the registry name, ``dct:title``.

Work Lookup Service
-------------------

Registries may provide a work lookup service which redirects the user
agent to the specific work registration page, if available.  Commoner
implements this service as a URL taking a single query-string
parameter, the URI to look up.

For example::

  GET /r/lookup?uri=http://example.org/work/

would redirect to a work registration page, if it exists.  If one does
not exist, the HTTP status code is set to 404.

Registries may advertise this service using the SIOC Service module.
The service is advertised using ``sioc_service:has_service`` and is
differentiated from other services by
``sioc_service:service_protocol``.  The protocol for work lookup is
identified by the URI ``http://wiki.creativecommons.org/work-lookup``.

For example, `creativecommons.net <http://creativecommons.net>`_
publishes the following two triples::

  <https://creativecommons.net/> <http://rdfs.org/sioc/services#has_service> <https://creativecommons.net/r/lookup/> .
  <https://creativecommons.net/r/lookup/> <http://rdfs.org/sioc/services#service_protocol> <http://wiki.creativecommons.org/work-lookup> .
