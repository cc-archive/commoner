Installation
============

Commoner uses `buildout <http://python.org/pypi/zc.buildout>`_ to
manage dependencies.  Buildout will handle retrieving most
dependencies for you.  To get started, run::

  $ python bootstrap.py

This will download `setuptools <>`_ and create the buildout script.
To retrieve dependencies and create control scripts run::

  $ ./bin/buildout

Configuration
-------------

Before you need to set some configuration parameters, including
database information. If you'd like to do the minimal amount of work
needed, simply open ``src/commoner/settings.py`` and edit the line
which reads::

 DEBUG = TEMPLATE_DEBUG = True

To read::

 DEBUG = TEMPLATE_DEBUG = False

This will use a SQLite database and allow you to play with the
software.  If you'd like to use a different database, edit the
appropriate settings in ``settings.py``.  See the Django database
settings documentation
(http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/settings/#database-engine)
for more information.

Database Specific Notes
-----------------------

MySQL Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~

The default character set for MySQL is latin1. When creating your
database you will need to specify the character set as utf8::

  mysql> create database commoner charset=utf8;


Testing Your Installation
-------------------------

After running buildout and configuring your database you can get
started by running::

  $ ./bin/django syncdb

This will initialize your database and prompt you to create an
administrative user.  After that is complete you can use the internal
webserver for testing::

  $ ./bin/django runserver

Opening your browser to http://localhost:8000/ will display the
Commoner homepage with the default look and feel (which is the same as
creativecommons.net).
