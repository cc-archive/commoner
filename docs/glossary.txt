   administrative interface
      A portion of the web application restricted to staff and
      administrators; typically found by adding ``/admin/`` to the
      site URL.

   authorization code
      An Authorization Code allows a user to create a new premium
      account or extend the expiration date of an existing one by a
      year.

   user profile
      Every User has a User Profile which contains information about
      them, such as their nick name, website, and a brief description
      of their participation with Creative Commons ("my story" in
      initial version).

      A User Profile may be free or premium (paid); if the account is
      a premium account, the expiration date controls when some
      premium features are disabled (see :ref:`account-expiration`).
