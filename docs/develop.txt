Included Applications
---------------------

Commoner is a `Django <http://djangoproject.com>`_ project made up of
several individual applications.  The applications are within the
``src/commoner`` directory in a checkout and are intended to work
together (that is, no attempt has been made to ensure they are able to
operate independently).  The applications included are:

=================  =====================================================
Application Name   Purpose
=================  =====================================================
profiles           Models and forms for user profile and accounts.
registration       Models, views for invitations and user registration.
scraper            Retrieve URLs and extract RDFa for use when 
		   registering works.
server             OpenID server implementation
works              Work registration and related views
=================  =====================================================

Running Tests
-------------

After you've checked out the code and run ``buildout`` you can run the
tests for Commoner using the ``django`` command line script::

  $ ./bin/django test

You can also run tests for a specific application by specifying the
application name.  For example::

  $ ./bin/django test works

Will run all the tests associated with the works application.
