Introduction
============

This document describes a light-weight method for connecting digital
Works with Registration information stored by a Registry.  The goal
is to develop a system which provides visible notice to visitors that
a Work is registered, without imposing additional limitations on what
Registry may be used or what software the visitor might be using.
The visible notice is important because it leads the user to the
Registry where she may find additional information about the ways in
which the work may be used or how to obtain additional rights.  We
also expect software developers to be interested in discovering
registration information.  [RDFa]_ provides a means of
describing the relationship between the Work and the Registry in a
way that is visible to users as well as machine readable.
Additionally, it allows individual registries to innovate around
identity and verification while maintaining Consumer interoperability.

This work also builds upon the work of [ccREL]_, [SIOC]_ and
[POWDER]_.  [ccREL]_ describes a language for publishing license and
attribution information about Works in a distributed manner.  Our
experience and success with publishing this information and using it
to drive applications informed the design of this specification.

When evaluating vocabularies for use, [SIOC]_ was
identified as an ideal candidate because it models the ownership and
containment semantics needed for a Registry.  Specifically, it allows
us to model the ownership of a Work by a Registrant (identified by the
their Profile URI).  It also allows us to model the containment of a
Work in a Registration.

Considering Registrations, it is desirable to allow simultaneous
registration of multiple Works.  The works may be logically grouped
together, such as different version of the same abstract work, or may
be grouped for convenience, such as registering an entire
blog. [POWDER]_ describes a mechanism for publishing descriptions of
multiple resources; in particular [GROUP]_ describes how to identiy
sets of resources based on their IRI.  We use a subset of this
fucnctionality for describing Work groups that are part of a
Registration.


Overview
========

#. The Registrant publishes an assertion that the work is registered
   at a Registry.
#. The Registry publishes assertions indicating the work is
   registered; the registration may identify the work by URI or by an
   IRI Set.
#. The Registry provides a lookup service as a convenience for
   Consumers.
#. Consumers wishing to verify the registration SHALL:

   #. Beginning with the Work URI, look for ownership assertions; this
      assertion will identify the Profile URI.
   #. Perform `resolution`_ on the Profile URI to build the
      registration graph.
   #. Perform `verification`_ to establish the authenticity of the
      claim.

Publishing
==========

This section describes how Registrants and Registries may publish
information about Work Registrations.  Examples are provided in
[RDFa]_ as well as [N3]_.  Note that the RDFa examples may
be written in multiple forms; those presented are simply one way to
write each.

The examples assume the following namespace mappings:

  =============  ==================================================
  Prefix          URL
  =============  ==================================================
   ``(none)``     ``http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml``
   ``cc``         ``http://creativecommons.org/ns#``
   ``dct``        ``http://purl.org/dc/terms/``
   ``powder``     ``http://www.w3.org/2007/05/powder#``
   ``sioc``       ``http://rdfs.org/sioc/ns#``
   ``rdf``        ``http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#``
  =============  ==================================================

These mappings may be achieved using the following XHTML::

  <html
    xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" 
    xmlns:cc="http://creativecommons.org/ns#"
    xmlns:dct="http://purl.org/dc/terms/"
    xmlns:powder="http://www.w3.org/2007/05/powder#"
    xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"
    xmlns:sioc="http://rdfs.org/sioc/ns#">


Registrant Publication
----------------------

The Registrant MUST publish an assertion that the work has an owner.
The owner resource MUST be a Registrant Profile.

.. admonition:: RDFa

   :: 

    This work is registered by 
    <a rel="sioc:has_owner"
       href="http://registry.example.org/users/auser">A. User</a>

.. admonition:: N3

   ::

    <> <http://rdfs.org/sioc/ns#has_owner>
         <http://registry.example.org/users/auser> .

The Registrant MAY publish information regarding the title, format and
creator.

Registar Publication
--------------------

Profile Information
*******************

This section describes requirements for Profiles published by
Registries.  A Profile SHOULD map to a Registrant.

The Registry MUST publish assertions regarding the Registrant at the
Profile URI.

.. admonition:: RDFa

   *published at* ``http://registry.example.org/users/auser/`` 
   :: 

     <span about="" typeof="sioc:User" 
           property="sioc:name">A. User</span>

.. admonition:: N3

   ::

     <http://registry.example.org/users/auser/> <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> 
          <http://rdfs.org/sioc/ns#User> .
     <http://registry.example.org/users/auser/> <http://rdfs.org/sioc/ns#name> "A. User"@en .

The Registry MUST publish information about a `Work Lookup`_ service
for Consumers to use.


.. admonition:: RDFa

   :: 

     <head xmlns:sioc_service="http://rdfs.org/sioc/services#">
        <link about="/" rel="sioc_service:has_service"
	      href="http://registrar.example.org/lookup/" />
        <link about="http://registrar.example.org/lookup/" 
	      rel="sioc_service:service_protocol"
	      href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/work-lookup" />
     </head>

.. admonition:: N3

   ::

     <http://registrar.example.org/> <http://rdfs.org/sioc/services#has_service> <http://registrar.example.org/lookup/> .
     <http://registrar.example.org/lookup/> <http://rdfs.org/sioc/services#service_protocol> <http://wiki.creativecommons.org/work-lookup> .

.. warning::
   The ``sioc_service:service_protocol`` identifier will almost
   certainly change as this specification develops.

The Registry MAY publish information about membership in the site or
specific groups:

.. admonition:: RDFa

   *published at* ``http://registry.example.org/users/auser/`` 
   :: 

     <a rel="sioc:member_of" 
        href="http://registry.example.org/">...</a>

.. admonition:: N3

   ::

     <http://registry.example.org/users/auser/> <http://rdfs.org/sioc/ns#member_of> 
        <http://registry.example.org/> .


If the Registry publishes membership information, the Registry
SHOULD publish simple information about container:

.. admonition:: RDFa

   :: 

     <a href="http://registry.example.org">
	<span property="dct:title">...</span>
     </a>

.. admonition:: N3

   ::

     <http://registry.example.org/> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/title> 
        "Sample Registry"@en .

Registration Information
************************

For each Registration the Registry MUST publish assertions linking the
Profile to the Registration.  Each Regsitration contains one or more
Works which are registered.  

Registrations MAY have their own pages.

.. admonition:: RDFa

   :: 

     <a about="http://registry.example.org/users/auser/" 
        rel="sioc:owner_of"
        href="http://example.org/~auser/work.html">
        ...
    </a>

.. admonition:: N3

   ::

     <http://registry.example.org/users/auser/> <http://rdfs.org/sioc/ns#owner_of>
          <http://example.org/~auser/work.html> .


Each Registration MUST include information to identify the registered
Work(s).  Registrations may contain multiple Works and have a
containment relationship with each Work.  Therefore a Registation is
described as the *parent* of the Work.  Works may be identified in the
Registration by URI or `using an IRI Set`_.

The Owner of the Registration is also the Profile.  The relationship
between the work and the Registration MUST be described as follows:

.. _using an IRI Set: `Identifying Works By IRI Set`_

.. admonition:: RDFa

   :: 

     <a about="http://registry.example.org/users/auser/registrations/1/"
        rel="sioc:parent_of" rev="sioc:has_parent"
     	href="http://example.org/~auser/work.html" />
     <a about="http://registry.example.org/users/auser/"
        rel="sioc:owner_of" rev="sioc:has_owner"
        href="http://registry.example.org/users/auser/registrations/1/">
	Registration Details
     </a>

.. admonition:: N3

   ::

     <http://example.org/~auser/work.html> <http://rdfs.org/sioc/ns#has_parent> 
        <http://registry.example.org/users/auser/registrations/1/> .

     <http://registry.example.org/users/auser/registrations/1/> <http://rdfs.org/sioc/ns#parent_of> 
	<http://example.org/~auser/work.html> .
     <http://registry.example.org/users/auser/registrations/1/> <http://rdfs.org/sioc/ns#has_owner> 
	<http://registry.example.org/users/auser/> .

     <http://registry.example.org/users/auser/> <http://rdfs.org/sioc/ns#owner_of> 
	<http://registry.example.org/users/auser/registrations/1/> .


Alternately a Registry MAY publish the Registration information on the
Profile page.

.. admonition:: RDFa

   *Published at* ``http://registry.example.org/users/auser/``:: 

     <div about="" id="reg1" rel="sioc:owner_of" resource="#reg1">
       <a href="http://example.org/~auser/work.html"
       rel="sioc:parent_of" rev="sioc:has_parent">registered work</a>
     </div>

.. admonition:: N3

   ::

     <http://registry.example.org/users/auser/> <http://rdfs.org/sioc/ns#owner_of> 
       <http://registry.example.org/users/auser/#reg1> .

     <http://registry.example.org/users/auser/#reg1> <http://rdfs.org/sioc/ns#has_owner> 
       <http://registry.example.org/users/auser/> .
     <http://registry.example.org/users/auser/#reg1> <http://rdfs.org/sioc/ns#parent_of> 
       <http://example.org/~auser/work.html> .

      <http://example.org/~auser/work.html> <http://rdfs.org/sioc/ns#has_parent> 
        <http://registry.example.org/users/auser/#reg1> .


A Registry MAY provide a page which gathers all Registration
information for this Profile.  The Registration index is identified on
the Profile page.

.. admonition:: RDFa

   *Published at* ``http://registry.example.org/users/auser/``:: 

     <a rel="cc:registrations"
        href="http://registry.example.org/users/auser/registrations/">
        all registrations
    </a>

.. admonition:: N3

   ::

     <http://registry.example.org/users/auser/> <http://creativecommons.org/ns#registrations>
          <http://registry.example.org/users/auser/registrations/> .

The Registration list MUST publish scoped assertions for each
Registration which belongs to the Profile.


Registration Details
********************

In addition to the contained Works, the Registry MAY publish
additional information about registrations.  This Registration
information may include information about when the Work was
registered, availability of copies, fingerprints or other Registry
specific information.


Identifying Works By IRI Set
****************************

It is sometimes desirable to register an entire group of works; for
example, an entire site that is created by an individual.  In this
case a Registry MAY support registration of a group of resources by
describing an `IRI Set`_.

POWDER describes a method for selecting a set of resources based on a
set of IRI patterns.  These patterns are used to describe registration
of a group of resources.  If a Registry supports IRI Set-based
registration, the Registry MUST publish this information as the
``iriset`` of the Registration.

[GROUP]_ outlines several ways of filtering IRIs, along with
`reductions to regular expressions
<http://www.w3.org/TR/2009/WD-powder-grouping-20090403/#byIRIcomp>`_.
Registries providing IRI Set registration MUST reduce inclusions to
the lowest common denominator, ``includeregex`` and ``excluderegex``.

Example
~~~~~~~

This example builds upon the `Registration Details`_ example and
defines an inclusion for all resources beginning with the URL
``http://example.org/blog``.

.. admonition:: RDFa

   :: 

     <div about="http://registry.example.org/users/auser/registrations/1/" 
          rel="powder:iriset">
  
      Includes all works beginning with this URL.
  
      <span property="powder:includeregex" 
            content="\:\/\/(([^\/\?\#]*)\@)?([^\:\/\?\#\@]*)(\:([0-9]+))?(\/blog)" />
      <span property="powder:includeregex" 
            content="\:\/\/(([^\/\?\#]*)\@)?([^\:\/\?\#\@]+\.)?(example\.org)(\:([0-9]+))?\/" />
  
      <span property="powder:includeregex" content="^(http)\:\/\/" /> 
     </div>

.. admonition:: N3

   ::

     <http://registry.example.org/users/auser/registrations/1/> <http://www.w3.org/2007/05/powder#iriset> _:n0 .

     _:n0 <http://www.w3.org/2007/05/powder#includeregex> "\\:\\/\\/(([^\\/\\?\\#]*)\\@)?([^\\:\\/\\?\\#\\@]*)(\\:([0-9]+))?(\\/blog)"@en .
     _:n0 <http://www.w3.org/2007/05/powder#includeregex> "\\:\\/\\/(([^\\/\\?\\#]*)\\@)?([^\\:\\/\\?\\#\\@]+\\.)?(example\\.org)(\\:([0-9]+))?\\/"@en .
     _:n0 <http://www.w3.org/2007/05/powder#includeregex> "^(http)\\:\\/\\/"@en .

Consumers MUST process rules by first applying inclusions, followed by
exclusions; see Verification_ for more information.

Work Lookup
===========

Registries MUST support the work lookup URI for resolving a Work URI
to its Registration if available.  The Work Lookup service is
advertised as part of the published `Profile Information`_.

The lookup service supports querying by URI.  A Consumer who wishes to
query the Registrar SHALL encode the Work URI as the ``uri`` parameter
in the HTTP querystring.  

* If the Work URI is registered the Registar MUST return a document
  with RDFa describing the registration as outlined in
  `Registration Information`_.

  * The Registrar MAY return an HTTP 200 with the document.
  * The Registrar MAY return an HTTP 302 with the URL of the specific
    Registration.  If the registrar returns a 302 the Consumer MUST
    follow to the Registration.

* If the Work URI is not registered, the Registrar MUST return an HTTP
  404.
* If multiple Registrations match the Work URI, the Registrar MUST
  return an HTTP 300.  The returned document MUST include RDFa
  describing all matching Registrations.


Consumers
=========

Resolution
----------

Consumers perform Resolution in order to establish the graph of
registration information for performing Verification.

#. Retrieve the Profile URI and extract the `Work Lookup`_ service URI.
#. Call the lookup service, specifying the Work URI.
#. The graph extracted from the call to the lookup service is the
   context for `Verification`_.


Verification
------------

Consumers perform Verification to confirm a Registration claim
published by a Registrant.  The procedure for verifying a claim is as
follows:

#. Establish the graph for evaluating Registration claims.  The graph
   SHOULD be established by performing `Resolution`_.
#. Query the graph for the owner of the Work URI.

   .. admonition:: SPARQL

      ::

         PREFIX sioc:  <http://rdfs.org/sioc/ns#>

	 SELECT DISTINCT ?profile

         WHERE {
      	     ?profile sioc:owner_of ?r .
             ?r sioc:has_owner ?profile .
         }


   If the Profile asserted by the Registrant published information is
   in the result set, Verification **succeeds**.

#. If the Profile asserted by the Registrant published information is
   not in the result set, Verification **fails**.
