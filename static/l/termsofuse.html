<h1>TERMS OF USE</h1>

<h2>www.creativecommons.net</h2>

<h4>(Effective October 1, 2008 &ndash; October 14, 2008)</h4>

<p>Please read these Terms of Use carefully because they apply to your use of the Creative Commons beta network website available at <a href="http://creativecommons.net">http://creativecommons.net</a> ("ccNet") and beta ccNet Services (defined below) for the duration of the beta release test period currently anticipated to take place between October 1, 2008 through and including October 14, 2008.  During the beta release test period, Creative Commons is allowing access to the beta ccNet website and the beta ccNet Services to identified members of our Creative Commons International community ("CCi") and select others for the purpose of allowing those persons to test the beta releases prior to public launch.</p>

<p>Your use of ccNet or the ccNet Services in any way signifies that you have read, understand and agree to be bound by these Terms of Use.  By accessing or using ccNet or any ccNet Services, including during the beta release test period, you also represent that you have the legal authority to accept these Terms of Use on behalf of yourself and any party you represent in connection with your use of ccNet and the ccNet Services. If you do not agree to these terms, you are not authorized to use ccNet or ccNet Services.</p>

<p>Creative Commons Corporation ("CC" or "Creative Commons"), a Massachusetts corporation with a business office at 171 Second St., Suite 300, San Francisco, California 94105, United States, makes ccNet and ccNet Services available to you to use on the terms and conditions set forth in these Terms of Use.</p>

<h3>Changes to these Terms of Use.</h3>

<p>From time to time, Creative Commons may change these Terms of Use, and reserves the right to do so in its sole discretion.  In that case, we will post the updated Terms of Use to the ccNet website and indicate the date of revision.  Your continued use of ccNet (whether or not through a ccNet account) or any ccNet Services after the revised Terms of Use have been posted indicate that you have read, understood and agreed to the current version of these Terms of Use.</p>

<h3>About ccNet Generally.</h3>

<p>Creative Commons makes ccNet and the ccNet Services available to you on these terms. You may only use ccNet and ccNet Services in accordance with these terms and, in particular but without limitation, you may not use ccNet or ccNet Services for any purpose that is unlawful or prohibited by these Terms of Use or any other conditions or notices that are made available at ccNet.  For example, you may not (and may not authorize another party to): (i) frame or otherwise co-brand this site (for example, by displaying a name, logo, trademark or other means of attribution of a third party that is reasonably likely to give the user the impression that that third party has the right to display, publish or distribute this site; or, (ii) use ccNet or ccNet Services in any manner that could disable, overburden, damage or impair ccNet or ccNet Services, or interfere with any other party's use and enjoyment of ccNet or ccNet Services.</p>

<h3>CC Network Membership.</h3>

<p>Becoming a member of the Creative Commons Network (the "CC Network") or using any of the ccNet Services is void where prohibited.  Only persons who are 18 years of age or older may join the CC Network and use the ccNet Services.  Any registration by, use of or access to ccNet or the ccNet Services by anyone under 18 is unauthorized, unlicensed and in violation of these Terms of Use.  By joining the CC Network, establishing an account on ccNet or using the ccNet Services, you represent and warrant that you are 18 or older, and that you agree to abide by all of the terms and conditions of these Terms of Use.</p>

<p>Subject to the terms and conditions in these Terms and Services, any person may join the CC Network when they donate US$50.00 or more (US$25.00 for students) to Creative Commons.  In addition, Creative Commons may offer membership in its CC Network on other terms as CC deems appropriate in its sole discretion.  Visit our <a href="http://support.creativecommons.org">support page</a> for more information about donating to Creative Commons.  Membership in the CC Network must be renewed annually based on the date of donation.  Your membership will expire automatically if not renewed prior to the anniversary of the last donation you made for the minimum amount required to maintain membership.  Creative Commons will use reasonable efforts to notify you of your renewal date in advance of expiration. Creative Commons reserves the right to change the annual minimum donation amount in its sole discretion (but never retroactively), and will use reasonable efforts to notify members of its CC Network in advance of their donation renewal date.</p>

<h3>ccNet and ccNet Services Generally.</h3>

<p>Features of Membership.  By joining the CC Network, members have the option of creating an account on ccNet and using the ccNet Services, which currently include:</p>

<ol>
      <li>a profile page for each member of the CC Network, where the member may, among other things, identify themselves, post a story about themselves ("Your Story"), and identify and provide links to works such member has licensed under a Creative Commons license ("list of works");</li>

      <li>a badge that members can place on website pages they create identifying them as a member of the CC Network, as well as on Creative Commons license deeds associated with their CC licensed works ("badge"); and</li>

      <li> OpenID service provided by Creative Commons.</li>
</ol>

<p>These features are collectively referred to in these Terms of Use as the "ccNet Services" and are provided subject to these Terms of Use.  Creative Commons reserves the right to modify or discontinue ccNet, membership in the CC Network, and any or all of the ccNet Services at any time, with or without notice of members of the CC Network.  Creative Commons disclaims any and all liability to members and third parties in the event CC exercises its right to modify or discontinue ccNet, membership in the CC Network, or any or all of the ccNet Services.  Any additional or modified ccNet Services offered by Creative Commons shall be subject to these Terms of Use.   See "Termination and Inactivation of CC Network Membership," below for a description of how ccNet Services may be affected when your CC Network membership terminates for any reason or becomes inactive.</p>

<p>Registration; Security; Notice.  You agree to (a) provide accurate, current and complete information about you as may be prompted by any registration forms on ccNet, (b) maintain the security of your password and identification, (c) maintain and promptly update your registration information and any other information you provide to Creative Commons, and to keep it accurate and complete to, among other things, allow us to contact you, and (d) be fully responsible for all use of your account and for any actions that take place using your account.  It is your responsibility to ensure that Creative Commons has up-to-date contact information for you.  You may not set up an account or a profile page on behalf of another individual or entity unless you are authorized to do so.</p>

<p>You agree that, in the event that Creative Commons is served with an infringement notice under section 512(c)(1)(C) of the US Copyright Act, Creative Commons will have taken reasonable steps (as required by section 512(g)(2)) if it promptly notifies you using the latest contact details you provided via your ccNet profile page.</p>

<p>No Membership in CC. As used in these Terms of Use, "member" means a person who has joined the CC Network and established an account on ccNet.  Joining the CC Network, establishing an account on ccNet or using the ccNet Services does not and shall not be deemed to make you a member, shareholder or affiliate of Creative Commons for any purposes whatsoever, nor shall you have any of the rights of statutory members as defined in Sections 2(3) and 3 of Chapter 180 of the General Laws of Massachusetts.</p>

<p>Privacy Policy.  Creative Commons is committed to handling responsibly the information and data we collect through our ccNet website and agrees to use your personal information in accordance with the <a href="/h/privacy/">CC Network Privacy Policy</a> and these Terms of Use. You agree that Creative Commons is authorized to disclose any information that is necessary to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process, court order, or government request.</p>

<p>ccNet is hosted in the United States.  If you are accessing the ccNet website from the European Union, Asia, or any other region with laws or regulations governing personal data collection, use, and disclosure, that differ from United States laws, please note that you are transferring your personal data to the United States which does not have the same data protection laws as the EU and other regions,.  By providing your personal data you consent to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>the use of your personal data for the uses identified above in accordance with the Privacy Policy; and</li>
    <li>the transfer of your personal data to the United States as indicated above.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Profile Pages; Badges.</h3>

<p>Creative Commons permits members of its CC Network to create and maintain a profile page.  Creative Commons does not pre-screen or approve profile pages, and cannot guarantee that a profile page was actually created and is being maintained by the individual or entity that is the subject of a profile page.  Creative Commons is not responsible for the content of any profile page, including without limitation the accuracy of any list of works or the provenance and/or ownership of such works, or the provenance or ownership of any works to which a badge may be affixed. </p>

<h3>OpenID Services.</h3>

<p>Members of the CC Network may choose to use their CC Network profile as an OpenID.  Using OpenID carries risks, some of which are described <a href="/h/openid/">here</a>, although there are others members should be aware of.</p>

<p>OpenID may be used, among other things, to access websites, engage in commercial and noncommercial transactions, and communicate with others (to share information, personal and non personal, as well as other purposes).  By using Creative Commons as your OpenID service provider, you acknowledge and agree that Creative Commons is not responsible or liable for any action or inaction of any third party involved, directly or indirectly, in any transaction or communication you engage in using your OpenID, for any third party’s failure to perform, to pay any amounts due, to keep your personal or other information or communications private, to deliver any merchandise or services as promised, or for any other aspects of any transaction or communication you engage in using your OpenID.  All transactions (whether commercial or non commercial) that you enter into and all communications that you engage in using your Creative Commons OpenID are strictly between you and the other party(ies) thereto.   </p>

<p>CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES OPENID SERVICES ON AN ‘AS IS’ BASIS.  YOU AGREE TO USE OPENID AND CREATIVE COMMONS AS YOUR OPENID SERVICE PROVIDER AT YOUR OWN RISK. </p>

<p>By using your Creative Commons OpenID, (a) you represent and warrant that you have reviewed the <a href="/h/openid/">information on ccNet</a> about OpenID and its risks, and that you have otherwise educated yourself to your own satisfaction about the risks associated with using OpenID before using OpenID, and (b) you agree to take reasonable care and precautions when using your OpenID, including but not limited to the following phishing countermeasures:</p>
<ol>
      <li>checking the lock icon and URL bar to ensure that you are indeed visiting Creative Commons whenever you use your OpenID login, and that the connection is properly authenticated, AND</li>

      <li>refusing to log in if the Creative Commons web site certificate is in any way invalid.</li>
</ol>


<h3>Termination; Termination and Inactivation of CC Network Membership.</h3>

<p>Your right to use ccNet, maintain an account on ccNet, and use the ccNet Services terminates automatically upon your breach of any of these Terms of Use.</p>

<p>In addition, Creative Commons may, at any time: (a) modify, suspend or terminate the operation of or access to ccNet or the ccNet Services, or any portion of ccNet or the ccNet Services, for any reason; (b) modify or change ccNet or the ccNet Services, or any portion of ccNet or the ccNet Services, and any applicable Terms of Use and policies governing the use of ccNet and the ccNet Services, for any reason; (c) interrupt the operation of ccNet or the ccNet Services, or any portion of ccNet or the ccNet Services, for any reason, all as Creative Commons deems appropriate in its discretion.  Creative Commons will use reasonable efforts to notify you in advance about any modification, suspension or termination.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Your membership in the CC Network, access to your account, and use of the ccNet Services may be terminated by you or by Creative Commons at any time and for any reason whatsoever.  In addition, membership in the CC Network may be inactivated automatically upon failure of a member to timely renew their annual membership.</li>

  <li>Each member of the CC Network agrees and understands that when their membership is terminated by either the member or Creative Commons for any reason, the following will occur:
    <ul>
      <li>the ccNet website page displaying their profile data will be deleted and discarded from the ccNet website;</li>
      <li>CC’s servers will stop serving a badge associating such person with the CC Network, resulting in the badge no longer appearing in any manner whatsoever on the Creative Commons license deeds associated with their CC licensed works; and</li>
      <li>the member’s account access on ccNet will terminate.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Further, each member of the CC Network agrees and understands that when their membership expires due to non renewal, the following will occur:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the ccNet website page displaying their profile may indicate to the public that the member is inactive through any means CC determines to be appropriate in its sole discretion (such as by stating "inactive" on such member’s profile page);</li>
  <li>CC’s servers will serve their badge as inactive, which Creative Commons may indicate through any means CC determines to be appropriate (such as by stating on the badge that the member is "inactive" or by changing the color or other design elements of the badge associated with the inactive member); and</li>
  <li>the member may continue to access their ccNet account but will not be able to edit their profile or other posted content (unless and until renewed); provided that upon request of the inactive member, Creative Commons will promptly delete such member’s profile and other posted content.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, Creative Commons reserves the right to delete and purge any account and all content associated therewith following any prolonged period of inactivity, all as may be determined by Creative Commons in its complete discretion.</p>

<h3>About the Content you Post to ccNet.</h3>

<p>As used in these Terms of Services, "content" includes but is not limited to photos, profiles (including name, location, image and likeness), text, information, list of works and the works so listed, stories (including "Your Story" that, collectively with the stories of others posted on ccNet, are called "Stories" in these Terms of Use), and any other content that is posted, uploaded or displayed ("post" or "posted") on or through ccNet or the ccNet Services.  You may only post content that you have the right to post.  For example, this means that you can only post content that you yourself create, that is in the public domain or that you have the express permission to use and post.  For the avoidance of doubt, materials that infringe the rights of any third party (ie. materials used without express permission of the copyright owner) may not be posted.  You represent, warrant and agree that no content of any kind submitted or posted through your account on ccNet, or submitted, posted or otherwise shared by you on through any ccNet Service, will violate or infringe upon the rights of any third party, including copyright, trademark, privacy, publicity or other person or proprietary rights, or contain libelous, defamatory or otherwise lawful material.</p>

<li>You may post and thereafter edit Your Story on ccNet for public viewing.  To the extent such content is copyrightable, as a condition to making the posting you must license Your Story to the world under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License</a>.  By submitting content (including Your Story) to ccNet, you represent and warrant to Creative Commons that you have all necessary rights and authority to upload such content to http://creativecommons.net, and in the case of Your Story, to license it to the world under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License.</li>

<p>You are solely responsible for the content that you post. Creative Commons may, but it not obligated to, review your postings and may delete or remove (without notice) any content in its sole discretion that Creative Commons determines violates these Terms of Use or that may be offensive, illegal, or that might violate the rights, harm or threaten the safety of others.  Creative Commons does not endorse or support any content posted on ccNet.</p>

<p>You alone are responsible for creating backup copies and replacing any content you post on ccNet, and you authorize Creative Commons to make copies of your content as we deem necessary in order to facilitate the posting of the content on ccNet.  You may remove your content from ccNet at any time.  If you choose to remove Your Story, the Creative Commons license granted above will remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.  Creative Commons does not assert any ownership over your content. As between Creative Commons and you, you retain full ownership of all of your content.</p>

<h3>Use of Content Posted to ccNet.</h3>

<p>You may use the Stories that you find on ccNet in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. You acknowledge that under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License, all rights not expressly granted under the terms of the license are reserved to the creator.  For the avoidance of doubt, you must attribute all Stories in the manner required by the author or licensor and in accordance with the terms of such license and you must not remove or alter any copyright, trademark, name or other notice or legend that appears in connection with a Story.  You represent and warrant to Creative Commons that you will use any and all Stories made available at ccNet in accordance with such license.  You should be sure to review the terms of that license before you use it so that you know what you can and cannot do with it.</p>

<p>By using ccNet, you agree that you are solely responsible for your use of any and all content made available thereon.  Further, you represent that you understand that all information and content made available at or submitted to the ccNet site is the sole responsibility of the person from which such content originated.  This includes assertions that persons may make, expressly or impliedly, about the provenance and ownership of content that they upload or list and/or link to on their profile page (including the list of works and the works so listed) or works to which a member of the CC network (whether active or inactive) has affixed a badge.  You also acknowledge that Creative Commons does not make any representations or warranties about the content, including without limitation, about the accuracy, integrity or quality of the content and information made available at the instigation of users of the ccNet site (including the provenance or ownership of works included on a list of works or any work to which a badge is affixed). You understand that by using the ccNet, you may be exposed to content that is offensive, indecent or objectionable.

<p>You agree that you must evaluate, and bear all risks associated with, the use of any content (including any works identified on a list of works or to which a badge has been affixed), including any reliance on the provenance, ownership, accuracy, completeness, or reliability of such content. In this regard, you acknowledge that you may not rely on any content not created by us or submitted to us, including without limitation information posted on or linked to from any profile page or elsewhere on ccNet, works identified on a list of works, or works to which a badge has been affixed). </p>

<p>You further agree that, while Creative Commons may make efforts to ensure that the content made available at ccNet is legal, non infringing and that the use of it in accordance with these Terms of Use and, where applicable, a Creative Commons license will not infringe the rights of any third party, Creative Commons cannot guarantee that content made available at ccNet, works identified on a list of works, or works to which a badge has been affixed do not infringe the rights of any third party.  </p>
