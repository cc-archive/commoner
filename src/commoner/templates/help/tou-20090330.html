      Features of Membership
    </h3>
    <p>
      By joining the CC Network, Members have the option of creating an account on ccNet and using the ccNet Services, which currently include, but may not be limited to:
    </p>
    <p>
      (1) a profile page for each Member of the CC Network, where the
      Member may, among other things, identify themselves, post a story
      about themselves ("Your CC Story"), and identify and provide links to
      works such Member has licensed under a Creative Commons license ("list
      of works"); the Member's full name, as displayed at registration, will
      be visible on this page;
    </p>
    <p>
      (2) a badge that Members can place on website pages they create identifying them as a Member of the CC Network, as well as on Creative Commons license deeds associated with their CC licensed works ("badge"); and
    </p>
    <p>
      (3) OpenID service provided by Creative Commons.
    </p>
    <p>
      These features (as such may be modified, eliminated or added to by CC in its sole discretion) are collectively referred to in these Terms of Use as the "ccNet Services" and are provided subject to these Terms of Use. Creative Commons reserves the right to modify or discontinue ccNet, membership in the CC Network, and any or all of the ccNet Services at any time. Creative Commons disclaims any and all liability to Members and third parties in the event CC exercises its right to modify or discontinue ccNet, membership in the CC Network, or any or all of the ccNet Services. Any additional or modified ccNet Services offered by Creative Commons shall be subject to these Terms of Use. See "<strong>Termination and Inactivation of CC Network Membership,</strong>" below for a description of how ccNet Services may be affected when your CC Network membership terminates for any reason or becomes inactive.

    </p>
    <p>
      You agree that, in the event that Creative Commons is served with an infringement notice under section 512(c)(1)(C) of the US Copyright Act, Creative Commons will have taken reasonable steps (as required by section 512(g)(2)) if it promptly notifies you using the latest contact details you provided via your ccNet profile page.

    <p>
      As used in these Terms of Use, "Member" means a person who has joined the CC Network and established an account on ccNet. Joining the CC Network, establishing an account on ccNet or using the ccNet Services does not and shall not be deemed to make you a member, shareholder or affiliate of Creative Commons for any purposes whatsoever, nor shall you have any of the rights of statutory members as defined in Sections 2(3) and 3 of Chapter 180 of the General Laws of Massachusetts.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Privacy Policy
    </h3>
    <p>
      Creative Commons is committed to handling responsibly the information and data we collect through our ccNet website and agrees to use your personal information in accordance with the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> and these Terms of Use. The Privacy Policy is hereby incorporated into these Terms.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Profile Pages; Badges.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Creative Commons may permit Members of its CC Network to create and maintain a profile page. Creative Commons does not pre-screen or approve profile pages, and cannot guarantee that a profile page was actually created and is being maintained by the individual or entity that is the subject of a profile page. Creative Commons is not responsible for the Content (as defined below) of any profile page, including without limitation the accuracy of any list of works or the provenance and/or ownership of such works, or the provenance or ownership of any works to which a badge may be affixed.
    </p>
    <h2>
      OpenID Services.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Members of the CC Network may choose to use their CC Network profile as an OpenID. Using OpenID carries risks, some of which are <a href="/h/openid/">described here</a>, although there are others that Members should be aware of.
    </p>
    <p>
      OpenID may be used, among other things, to access websites, engage in commercial and noncommercial transactions, and communicate with others (to share information, personal and non personal, as well as other purposes). By using Creative Commons as your OpenID service provider, you acknowledge and agree that Creative Commons is not responsible or liable for any action or inaction of any third party (including without limitation operators of websites you access using your OpenID) that is involved, directly or indirectly, in any transaction or communication you engage in using your OpenID, for any third party's failure to perform, to pay any amounts due, to keep your personal or other information or communications private, to deliver any merchandise or services as promised, or for any other aspects of any transaction or communication you engage in using your OpenID. All transactions (whether commercial or non commercial) that you enter into and all communications that you engage in using your Creative Commons OpenID are strictly between you and the other party(ies) thereto.
    </p>
    <p>
      CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES OPENID SERVICES ON AN 'AS IS' BASIS. YOU AGREE TO USE OPENID AND CREATIVE COMMONS AS YOUR OPENID SERVICE PROVIDER AT YOUR OWN RISK.
    </p>
    <p>
      By using your Creative Commons OpenID, (a) you represent and warrant that you have reviewed the <a href="/h/openid/">information on ccNet</a> about OpenID and its risks, and that you have otherwise educated yourself to your own satisfaction about the risks associated with using OpenID before using OpenID and agree to assume all such risks, and (b) you agree to take reasonable care and precautions when using your OpenID, including but not limited to the following phishing countermeasures:
    </p>
    <p>
      (1) checking the lock icon <em>and</em> URL bar to ensure that you are indeed visiting Creative Commons whenever you use your OpenID login, and that the connection is properly authenticated, AND
    </p>
    <p>
      (2) refusing to log in if the Creative Commons web site certificate is in any way invalid.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Termination; Termination and Inactivation of CC Network Membership.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Your right to use ccNet, maintain an account on ccNet, and use the ccNet Services terminates automatically upon your breach of any of these Terms of Use.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, Creative Commons may, at any time: (a) modify, suspend or terminate the operation of or access to ccNet or the ccNet Services, or any portion of ccNet or the ccNet Services, for any reason; (b) modify or change ccNet or the ccNet Services, or any portion of ccNet or the ccNet Services, and any applicable Terms of Use and policies governing the use of ccNet and the ccNet Services, for any reason; (c) interrupt the operation of ccNet or the ccNet Services, or any portion of ccNet or the ccNet Services, for any reason, all as Creative Commons deems appropriate in its discretion. Your membership in the CC Network, access to your account, and use of the ccNet Services may be terminated by you or by Creative Commons at any time and for any reason whatsoever. Creative Commons will use reasonable efforts to notify you in advance about any material modification, suspension or termination by CC that is not caused by your breach of these Terms. Membership in the CC Network may also be inactivated automatically upon failure of Member to timely renew their annual membership.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each Member of the CC Network agrees and understands that when their membership is terminated by either the Member or Creative Commons for any reason, CC may take certain actions relating to the Member's access to the ccNet Services, including but not limited to the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        the ccNet website page displaying their profile data will be deleted and discarded from the ccNet website;
      </li>
      <li>
        CC's servers will stop serving a badge associating such person with the CC Network, resulting in the badge no longer appearing in any manner whatsoever on the Creative Commons license deeds associated with their CC licensed works; and
      </li>
      <li>
        the Member's account access on ccNet will terminate.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Further, each Member of the CC Network agrees and understands that when their membership expires due to non renewal, CC may take certain actions related to the Member's account access to the ccNet Services, including but not limited to the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        the ccNet website page displaying their profile may indicate to the public that the Member is inactive through any means CC determines to be appropriate in its sole discretion (such as by stating "inactive" on such Member's profile page);
      </li>
      <li>
        CC's servers will serve their badge as inactive, which Creative Commons may indicate through any means CC determines to be appropriate (such as by stating on the badge that the Member is "inactive" or by changing the color or other design elements of the badge associated with the inactive Member); and
      </li>
      <li>
        the Member may continue to access their ccNet account but may not be able to edit their profile or other posted Content (defined below) (unless and until renewed); provided that upon request of the inactive Member, Creative Commons will promptly delete such Member's profile and other posted Content.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In addition, Creative Commons reserves the right to delete and purge any account and all Content associated therewith following any prolonged period of inactivity, all as may be determined by Creative Commons in its complete discretion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The disclaimer of warranties, the limitation of liability and the jurisdiction and applicable law provisions shall survive any termination. The license grants mentioned herein shall continue in effect subject to the terms of the applicable CC license. Your warranties and indemnification obligations shall survive any termination for one year.

    <p>
      You may post and thereafter edit Your CC Story on ccNet for public viewing.

      These Terms of Use are governed by and construed by the laws of the State of California, USA, exclusive of its choice of law rules. The parties agree that any disputes or proceedings between Creative Commons and you concerning these Terms of Use, ccNet and ccNet Services shall be brought in a federal or state court of competent jurisdiction sitting in California, US, and hereby consent to the personal jurisdiction and venue of such court. Either party's failure to insist on or enforce strict performance of any of these Terms of Use shall not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right. If any term or part of these Terms of Use is held to be invalid or unenforceable by any law or regulation or final determination of a competent court or tribunal, that provision will be deemed severable and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.

These terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Creative Commons relating to this subject matter and supersede all prior, contemporaneous and future communications (with the exception of future amendments to these Terms of Use as made available by Creative Commons from time to time) between you and Creative Commons. A printed version of these Terms of Use and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based on or relating to these Terms of Use to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generating and maintained in printed form.
