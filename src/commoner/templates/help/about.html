<div id="about">
<p>
When you support Creative Commons with an annual contribution of US$50 ($25 for students)  you receive a membership in the Creative Commons Network. The CC Network includes:
</p>
<ul id="benefits">
	<li id="openid"> <img src="/m/images/benefits/openid.png" /><h3>OpenID support</h3>
		 <p>Your CC Network profile acts as an OpenID. OpenID allows you to log into many sites without exposing your credentials to them. Creative Commons' OpenID implementation puts privacy first, <a href="/h/openid/">read how here</a>.</p></li>
	<li id="identify"> <img src="/m/images/benefits/identify.png" /><h3>Identify Your Works</h3>
		 <p>When you support Creative Commons financially, we're able to say with greater certainty that we know who you are. We give you a badge you can place on pages you create identifying you as a member of the Creative Commons Network. This badge not only gives visible notice that you support Free Culture, but allows us to help identify you on license deeds<!-- [link to "comic" explaining how identification works]-->.</p></li>
	<li id="share"> <img src="/m/images/benefits/share.png" /><h3>Share Your Story</h3>
		<p>
		You're the reason CC works. Now, as CC continues to grow, it's important that we capture and share the stories of how our worldwide community uses CC, so that others may come to understand the benefits of the Creative Commons. We want to hear your stories of how CC has helped you make and disseminate your work. <a href="/p/edit/">Tell us, and the world, why CC is important to you</a>.

</ul>
